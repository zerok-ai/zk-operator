# Zerok-operator
Using the Zerok Operator, traces can be filtered using probes to enhance observability within Kubernetes clusters. A probe is a set of rules defined by the user for capturing traces of interest. The probes are created using the `ZerokProbe` custom resource definition (CRD). You can refer to the [ZEROKPROBE.md](ZEROKPROBE.md) for details about creating the `ZerokProbe` CRD.
